## Autonomous ODE's

Dy/dt = f(y); no independent variables on the right hand side;

Seperating variables;

Getting qualitative information without solving the equation

All isoclines are horizontal because dy/dt is not changed along with t/independent variable

Also, the integral lines are exactly the same 

### Critical Point

Crictical point is a point where f(y_i)=0 y_0; then f(y_0) = 0; the slope on the level y=y_0 is zero/horizontal; also, y=y_0 is a solution; 

If there's another point y_1 s.t. f(y_1)=0; then there're two horizontal lines on the direction field; they will form two barriers b/c other curves can't cross these lines

Stepsâ€¦ 

1. Find the critical points
2. Draw the graph of f(y)
3. ...



Draw the plot of dy/dt to y; analyze how dy/dt changes along with y

Logistic equation

Stable critical point; unstable critical point; semi-stable;

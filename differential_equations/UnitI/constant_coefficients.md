Steady state; constant coefficiernt; transient; input q(t); for e.g., the external temperature is the input and internal temperature is the response; the response is the solution to ODE; 

Superposition of input;

Input is trigonometry

Cos wt

W: angular frequency/ # complete oscillations in 2pi 

abs(1/\alpha) = 1/abs(\alpha) â€¦.

Some formulas...

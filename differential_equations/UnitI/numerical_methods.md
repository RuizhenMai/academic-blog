## Euler's Method

when it's Euler's Method too high or to low, i.e., overesimate or underesimate? It's too low when the curve is convex and too high when the curve is concave. 
We can know if a curve is convex or concave(at least at that point) by finding the second order derivative. So how to do that with differential equations? If we can seperate out the derivative, we can use implicit differentiation:

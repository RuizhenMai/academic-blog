title: Decoupling Linear Systems with Constant Coefficients (Homogeneous)
date: 2019-7-3
---

Along with we've studied in the last note about matrix exponential, there're a total of 3 ways to calculate the solutions of linear homogeneous system 

- First is the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in [note 25](./25_first_order_system_continued)
- Second is the matrix exponentials $e^{At}$ in [note 29](./29_matrix_exponentials)

- The third one we're gonna study today is the decoupling

Coupled 

Physics, essence of problems, find $u,v$

Eigenvalues must be real and complete (not defective). Symmetric matrix.

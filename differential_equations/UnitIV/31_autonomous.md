A first order non-linear autonomous systems is s.t.
$$
\begin{align}
x'&=f(x,y)\\
y'&=g(x,y)
\end{align}
$$
There's no explicit $t$ on the right hand side, and $x,y$ can interact with itself or each other. 

There's no explicit solutions to such system, the only way is to <u>sketch trajectories</u>.

A big part of this (video) series will be on first order (differential) equations and second order equations. These are the most seen in applications and we can understand and solve if lucky. 

### First Order Equations

A first order equation means at most first derivative (no second derivative) is in the equation. A linear example:
$$
\frac{dy}{dt}=ay+q(t)
$$
The rate of change of $$y$$ w.r.t. time, i.e., the derivative, depends on the $$y$$ itself and $$q(t)$$ is a function of input $$t$$. Note that $$y$$ here is linear but $$q(t)$$ does not have to. A non-linear example:
$$
\frac{dy}{dt}=f(y)
$$
We can think of $$y$$ as the money in bank, then the interest rate will linearly or nonlinearly depend on how much we put in the bank. 

### Second Order Equations

Second order is the acceleration, the bending of the curve. A linear one:
$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2}=-ky
$$
More general one:
$$
my''+by'+ky=f(t)
$$
mass $m$ affects the accelartion, and there could be friction $$b$$ slows the rate down. (not important, just an example)

### Good Equations 

One is linear with constant coefficients; exponential function; 

### System of n equations

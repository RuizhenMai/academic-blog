## Formula for Determinant

The lecture explains it clearly 

### Cofactors

Cofactor of $$a_{ij}$$ is $$c_{ij}=\pm *\det(n-1\ matrix\ with\ row\ i\ col\ j\ removed)$$ and is +1 when $$i+j$$ is even and -1 when it is odd. $$c_{ij}$$ is the cofactor.With cofactor, we can write the formula for determinant "more" concisely
$$
\det A=a_{11}c_{11}+...a_{1n}c_{1n}
$$
This in fact is not constrained to row 1, it can happen to any rows in the matrix,
$$
\det A=a_{i1}c_{i1}+...+a_{in}c_{in}
$$

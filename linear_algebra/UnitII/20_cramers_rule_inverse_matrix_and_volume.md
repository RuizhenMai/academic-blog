## Application of determinant

Determinant packs all the information of a matrix into a single number. One is we can get a formula for inverses:
$$
A^{-1}=\frac{1}{\det A}C^\top
$$
where $$C^\top$$ is the cofactor matrix. Why this work? â€¦ 

Kinda useless as well. 

## Cramer's Rule

Kinda useless; 

## Volume

Determinant of a matrix is equal to the volume of box. The box is composed by the row vectors of the matrix;

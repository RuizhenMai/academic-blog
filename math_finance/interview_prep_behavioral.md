### Introduction

Self Introduction Oral:

I'm Ruizhen, I also go by Kevin.

I'm a junior in New York University double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. People sometimes say taking such two difficult majors are crazy but it  provides me a comprehensive background combining these two fields. 

So far I have several experiences in machine learning and statistics. One I'm currently working on is to be an undergrad researcher with Prof. Loftus. During this work I've been conducting research on how to fill in missing data more properly, specifically I've looked into the details on MICE and EM. Another job I'm working on is also to be a research assistant for Tommaso Bondi, during which I have done a lot of data science work, for example, I've been collecting and cleaning 100K book reviews data, looking for correct indicator for the problems he want to tackle, and built a convolutional neural network to classify sentiments of book reviews. 

Based on my previous experience, I am good at synthesizing information, handling data and leveraging up-to-date knowledge to solve real-life problem.

Self Introduction Hirevue:

I'm Ruizhen, I also go by Kevin.

I'm a rising junior in New York University double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. People sometimes say taking such two difficult majors are crazy; clearly it brings me a lot of pressure, but I do get a lot of rewards and it somewhat provides me a comprehensive background combining these two fields. 

Among the areas I study, I particularly focus on machine learning and statistics. So far I have several experiences on these two fields. One of the project I'm currently working on is to be research assistant for Tommaso Bondi, during which I have done a lot of data science work, for example, I've been collecting and cleaning over 100K data, and built a convolutional neural network to classify sentiments of book reviews. Another project I'm working on is also to be an undergrad researcher with Prof. Loftus. During this work I've been conducting research on how to fill in missing data more properly, specifically I've done a lot of work on MICE and EM. 

Doing three researches at the same time may sound crazy but I have planned my time ahead carefully. So that with a detailed scheduling, I also took an intro to finance class on the summer to enrich my knowledge on financial markets and financial instruments. 

Being research assistants trains me to express my ideas quick and sharp to professors, and understand their assigned tasks correctly. Based on my previous experience, I am good at synthesizing information, handling data, communicating efficiently and leveraging up-to-date knowledge to solve real-life problem. 

### Why Morgan Stanley

First off, Morgan Stanley is a top-rank investment banks at all aspects. Aside from the reputations, the alumni I've met on the info session all spoke highly of Morgan Stanley's internship program, they said they were given a lot of care during the training phase. And definitely, not many companies like Morgan Stanley offers a variety of opportunities to undergrad, from freshman to senior, all have the relative programs. So I do admire Morgan Stanley's effort on fostering students and bringing new blood to the financial industries.

### At last

I have a brief understanding on cross desk strategy; according to my understanding, it's about managing the performance of traders, analyze how they did, why they did good or bad, but could you elaborate more on what you do?

Deal with trader? How to work with Trader

How to play into the role of the whole company? 

Problem? How to deal with?

### What are your weakness

 I think one of my major weakness is I always prioritize the things I love. When there's a conflict between things I like and things I don't like, even the disliked side is urgent, I tend to delay the disliked problem later. One example was an anthropology class required for graduation. It asked us to memorize how apes became homo sapien, recognize the bones on humans and etc. I don't like this subject. So as long as there're weekly homework from this class, I tended to do others first, and did the anthropology at the very last minute and eventually didn't get quite a good grade in the class as I did in my other cs and math classes. 

But I'm much better right now. During summer I have a lot of free time so that I can schedule them ahead properly. As long as I distribute the things I don't a bit everyday, eventually I will finish them and not have to cram them up at the last minute. 

### What is a global event that can effect the financial market

One of the biggest global headline in financial market must be the trade war between US and China. I've been following this event recently. Until today, after Trump has announced 10% tariff on another $300 billion import from China, China hasn't made any responses yet. Many have predicted that China will retaliate, rather than just sit and wait. At any rate, this is not a good news to the stock market. The news on new imposed tariffs has already caused the S&P 500 to slump on the day of Trump’s announcement. In my opinion, the manufacture industry has been the most impacted sector. According to Bloomberg, the U.S manufacture output has declined in consecutive quarters, which is a  common definition of recession in the industry. Internationally, China experienced the slowest quarterly growth on record, and German also experienced the second-weakest quarterly growth since 2013. Many worry that, including me, the depressed manufacture will pull down the whole economy. A weak manufacture means elevated inventories, a decrease of price, and in turn limit the production cause; all these compose a serious negative feedback loop. Some most affected stocks are Lenovo, whose laptop exports to US are their major income; they experienced almost up to 10% decline of return in the past 3 montns, the whole computer production industry didn’t do well either, suffering up to 16% decline of return in the past 3 month, probably due to the increased cost of imported ingredients from China, and 3M experienced an up to 17% decline of yearly return.

### How to solve a complex problem

work in teams; strategy consultants; be mind of pitfalss, cognitive science, design thinking, CEO; holistic?; ai, analytical help; 

I believe there're essentially three steps to solve a complex problem-- state, deconstruct, and solve. The most important and first step is to state the problem correctly. What problem is it? Like if I were Mark Zuckerberg, how do I deal with the Cambridge Analytics leak? The pitfall is often times a complex problem is disguised in a routine problem, and people thought there would a routine solution to the problem, but in effect there isn't. One example would be at the turning of 21st century, the music industry suddenly realized that students are downloading musics for free. They recognized this as a piracy problem, or they thought they recognized it. And the solution for such problem is suing. Sue the bastards. They align with the industries and get those pirate websites shutdown. But they did not solve the right problem. The folks in Apple solved the right problem, they realized that the real problem is how to make money in the age of digital music. Then they created the ipod and itune store. 

After we correctly identify what kind of problem is it, then we'd be able to decompose them into different parts, and if there were a team, we can assign people specialized on the particular fields to solve them. Like back to the Facebook example, the Cambridge Analytics leak is a combination of marketing problem, public relation problem and technical problem. So we deconstruct the problem into different pieces, and eventually solve them, using all the modern analytic tools we have. Some worry that with the advent of artificial intelligence, AI can solve all the problems for us. But they can’t. The most helpful assistance AI can offer is to solve the routine problem we define, and it’s still essentials for us to state and deconstruct the problem correctly. 



### Describe a situation in which you learned something significant from a mistake you made at work or in a school project.

 On the fall semester of my sophomore year, I overloaded 20 credits, while normally people at most take 18 credits. Unfortunately, five classes I chose were either hard or time consuming. I ended up not receiving good grades, and particularly doing bad in an anthropology class. After that, I carefully ponder what mistakes did I make on class selections. One is my bad time management skills, I did not divided and schedule time appropriately; I did not spent enough time in studying each class, and I particularly spent less time on the anthropology class. The other is my inability to assess the difficulty of classes and did not prepare for the hard ones. So after that, before each class enrollment, I meticulously examine the classes’ difficulty, and extra time I needed for extracurricular activities, like preparing and applying for internship. And after I enroll in a hard class, I preview the materials during a break, one example was a graduate machine learning last semester, I self-studied a lot during the winter break so I could catch the pace easily. And I ended up receive all A’s in the last semester. And thank to my wildly improved time management skills, during this summer I multi-task three research assistants job during the summer. Meanwhile I also finished an intro to finance class and receive an A from it. Maybe I learnt the importance of time management in a hard way, but right now I’m good at handling my time, tackling hard classes and problems efficiently step by step, and leveraging the large amount of free time in the summer break to study extensively on things I like.

### A situation that you go beyond

I think I always push myself beyond the minimum requirements on subjects that I have deep interest in. One example is a job I’m currently working on, being an research assistant with Tomasso Bondi. He is a 5th year phd marketing student and I’m needed to assist him in finishing his phd dissertation, which is also a job market paper. Originally I was asked to use my machine learning knowledge to perform sentiment classification on user reviews on books. The problem was that the person that supposed to give him data was working very slowly, and eventually the data arrived were in very bad quality, like there were a lot of blanks, some items were incorrect and etc. So without a proper dataset we were both stuck. Then I willingly asked him do you need me to scrape the data, it’s just easy work, I did know other things than just machine learning. So he started giving me more and more tasks, other than just collecting data. I became more and more involved in his research. I helped him do a lot of data science work, find appropriate indicators on phenomenons we’re interested in, perform statistical inferences and do linear regressions to analyze variance on user’s reviews and etc. Up to today, he gave me a lot of thankfulness, complimented me for giving him outstanding research assistance on his paper’s acknowledgement, and he ended up being one of 5 finalists in Harvard Business School recruiting. Not only he received helps from me, I also learnt a lot in this experience, especially data science, so I deem my initiative to go beyond is a win-win situation.

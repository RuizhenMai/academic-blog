### How did probability start?

Games of chances started in ancient civilization when people had a propensity to gamble. They always wanted to make sense on odds. 

Games of chances are essentially repeatable. An experimental verification is possible. We can play it many many times to verify our assumptions. And that makes game of chances easier to deal with than real-life uncertainty 

### What is Stochastic Process

A stochastic process is a special type of probability models in which the sample points represent functions in time. More clearly, basic probability models often have a finite sample space. Stochastic process models the problem such that the sample space is time, and every sample we draws is one sample point from a sequence of time (trials). 

### Processes to be studied

- Counting processes - each sample point is a sequence of "arrival" times. A sample point specifies everything about an experiment. 
- Renewal Processes and Markov chain
- Random walks and martingale 



A random variable $X$ is not specified by its distribution $F_X(x)$, we also need to know the relationship between rv's.
